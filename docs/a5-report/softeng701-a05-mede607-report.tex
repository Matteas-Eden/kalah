\section{Planning the Change Case}
Before any code was actually written, a plan was devised describing the minimal
amount of changes that would be required to achieve the desired change case.
This plan is as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the \texttt{GameConfig} class
  \item Change the value of \texttt{VERTICAL\_OUTPUT} from \texttt{true} to
    \texttt{false}
  \item Find the \texttt{Kalah} class
  \item Find the \texttt{Play} method
  \item Within the \texttt{while} loop, modify the assignment to the variable
    \texttt{selection} to read: \texttt{selection = (playerNum == 1)
    ? GameIO.computeMove(board, playerNum, io) : GameIO.getMove(board, playerNum, io);}
  \item Find the \texttt{GameIO} class
  \item Create a new method: \texttt{public static int computeMove(Board board,
    int playerNum, IO io)}
  \item Implement the \texttt{computeMove} method
\end{enumerate}

\section{Implementing the Change Case}
The total amount of time taken to implement the change case was timed as being 
15 minutes and 58 seconds. During the execution of the aforementioned plan, there were some
issues encountered. Overall, the plan was a success and it was not difficult to
implement the change case. A breakdown of the steps carried out follows. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item No issues in finding the \texttt{Kalah} class.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Impact of the Change Case}
On a scale from \textit{0.0} to \textit{1.0}, the impact of this change case is
\textit{0.3}. Although the rules of the \textit{Kalah} are preserved and the
overall functionality of the game is preserved, the replacement of the second
player with a simple AI changes the game from being multi-player to being
single-player.
