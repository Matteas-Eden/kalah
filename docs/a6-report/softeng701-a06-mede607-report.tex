\begin{abstract}
  As part of an investigation into changeability, I was tasked with creating an
  implementation of Kalah that followed an object-oriented design and aimed to
  have high changeability. This design was then subjected to 2 change cases,
  one concerned with the game output and another concerned with replacing one
  player with a bot. Through these change cases I gained some understanding of
  changeability and what it means in practice.

\section{Introduction}
To investigate changeability and better understand the abstract ideas presented
in the course \textit{SOFTENG 701 - Advanced Software Engineering Development
Methods}, I was tasked with creating an implemention of the traditional game
\textit{Kalah} in Java 7. The aims of this design was to have high
changeability, where changeability is defined as ``How much it costs to make
the necessary changes to existing code (not new code) once those changes have
been identified'' \cite{lec01b-changeability}. The changeability of this design
was then tested through two change cases, the first of which was concerned with
the display of the game and the second with the actions of the player.

\section{Designing for Changeability}
Looking back on my original design, there are several aspects of it that do not
hold up to scrutiny when considering changeability. However, this is to be
expected as at that point in time I did not have a good formal understanding of
changeability, as it has been presented in this course. Previously, if I had
been asked about how one might design code such that it is changeable, the
advice I would have given would be in regards to ensuring atomicity in methods
and classes. I would give this advice with the mindset that a changeable design
is one that is `pluggable'; new functionality can be added in without much
change to the current design and elements of the design can be taken out and
put into other designs. Although this advice does sound good at face value, and
has done well for me thus far, it lacks formality. In contrast to the view of
changeability presented in this course, I wouldn't have made mention of
a \textit{changeability index}, or considered that a design is still
changeable regardless of how much new code is written for a change case. I also
would not have considered much of the advice presented in this course, such as
design patterns or the SOLID principles.

Having now gotten to a point where I am aware of this advice, I can start to
see some flaws in my original design. Particularly in regards to SOLID
principles, such as the \textit{Single Responsibility Principle}
\cite{lec07-solid}. I have a class that violates this principle,
\texttt{GameIO}. By the very nature of the class, it has two responsibilities:
player input and game output. This was intentional at the time as I had been
following a game design pattern I used in a previous project that used
a similar context (the context being a local multiplayer command-line Java game).
This decision did not support changeability from a design perspective, if we
consider that violating one of the SOLID principles reduces changeability. 

On the other hand, if we consider the changeability index (CI)
\cite{lec01b-changeability} for change cases that might involve changing player
input and game output, then we can consider that this approach provides
good changeability. The reason being that more classes are changed when
input/output are separated, and so that increases the CI if we assume that
other variables (total number of classes and impact of change case) are kept
constant.

\section{Understanding Changeability through Change Cases}
Although the changeability of a design can be evaluated through looking the
design principles being followed, ultimately, whether a design is changeable
can only be seen through the experience of attempts to change it. That is to
say, change cases. The reason why this is the case is that changeability is
concerned with how changeable a design is. Yet, if one never changes the
design, to talk about the changeability of it appears futile. For my design, 
there were two change cases that I successfully performed and both of them 
provided insights into changeability.

The first change case was concerned with modifying game output
\cite{a4-change-case} illustrated the changeability of my design. In that
reflection, I concluded that my design had good changeability due to the ease
with which I implemented that change case. I provided such arguments as ``[it]
resulted in minimal impact on the functionality of the implementation'', and it
can been seen in the change plan that the majority of the changed code occured
in a single method within a single class. If we then look at the changeability
index from that change case, this also supports the idea that there was good
changeability.
\begin{equation}
  CI = (3 / 7) * 0.1 = 0.04286
\end{equation}
Values for CI that fall below \texttt{1.0} are considered indicators of 'good'
changeability, and values that exceed \texttt{1.0} are considered indicators of
'bad' changeability. So the CI here tells us that for this change case there
was 'good' changeability. 

The second change case was concerned with adding a bot in place of the second
player, changing the game from multiplayer (with two human players) into
singleplayer (a human player against a computer player) \cite{a5-change-case}.
In implementing that change case, I ended up writing a large amount of new code
due to being unable to easily modify the pre-existing code. I then used this to
conclude that the changeability of my design could be improved, in spite of the
fact that very little of the pre-existing code was modified. This conclusion
\textit{did not} follow the definition of changeability provided in this
course. Again, if we consider the CI, we can see that the design has good
changeability.
\begin{equation}
  CI = (1 / 7) * 0.3 = 0.04286
\end{equation}
