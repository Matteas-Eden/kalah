\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  As part of an investigation into changeability, I was tasked with creating an
  implementation of Kalah that followed an object-oriented design and aimed to
  have high changeability. This design was then subjected to 2 change cases,
  one concerned with the game output and another concerned with replacing one
  player with a bot. Through these change cases I gained some understanding of
  changeability and what it means in practice.
